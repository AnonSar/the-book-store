# Web Dev Books Collection :books:

A book store type of web application developed in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) which makes use of [Google BooksAPI](https://developers.google.com/books). In this application I have listed most of the books that I have often reffered to, in order to learn about MERN stack. In order to get a more deeper insight regarding the books listed on the webiste, I have used the Google BooksAPI which provides the user with other furthur details of the books.

**Motivation:** While learning about MERN stack, I observed that I often reffered to some particular set of books. At the same time I was looking for an avenue to implement my learning thus, I came up with this idea of developing a website which will list all the books that I have used in order to learn about the MERN stack. I believe, this website can be helpful for other people as well who happen to be totally new to learning MERN stack.

**Happy Coding** :octocat:**!**
