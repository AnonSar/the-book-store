# Web Dev Books Collection :books:

![React Bage](https://img.shields.io/badge/ReactJS-React%20for%20Web-blue?logo=react)

A book store type of web application developed in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) which makes use of [Google BooksAPI](https://developers.google.com/books). In this application I have listed most of the books that I have often reffered to, in order to learn about MERN stack. In order to get a more deeper insight regarding the books listed on the webiste, I have used the Google BooksAPI which provides the user with other furthur details of the books.

**Happy Coding** :octocat:**!**
